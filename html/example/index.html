      <h3>Overview</h3>

      <p>The purpose of this course is to introduce the theory and
      practice of <i>functional programming (FP)</i>. The characteristic
      feature of FP is the emphasis on computation as evaluation. The
      traditional distinction between program and data characteristic
      of <i>imperative programming (IP)</i> is replaced by an emphasis on
      classifying expressions by types that specify their applicative
      behavior. Types include familiar (fixed and arbitrary precision)
      numeric types, tuples and records (structs), classified values
      (objects), inductive types such as trees, functions with specified
      inputs and outputs, and commands such as input and output.
      Well-typed expressions are evaluated to produce values, in a manner
      that is guaranteed to be type-safe. Because functional programs do
      not cause side-effects we can take advantage of simple mathematical
      principles in reasoning about applicative behavior and analyzing the
      runtime properties of programs.</p>

      <p>The advantages of FP are significant:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><i>Verification:</i> There is a close correspondence between
        the mathematical reasoning that justifies the correctness of a program
        and the program itself. Principles of proof by mathematical induction
        go hand-in-hand with the programming technique of recursion.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Moreover, FP generalizes IP by treating commands as forms of data
      that may be executed for their effects.</p>
